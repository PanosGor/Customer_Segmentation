# Customer_Segmentation
This is a Customer Segmentation model made in Python 

## Goal

The goal of the first part of this project is to create segments of wholesale customers and then try to characterize those segments based on their content. 
For the clusters-segments to be created multiple clustering methods were used.

## The dataset

The dataset used contains 440 wholesale customers and their spendings on the following goods: Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper and Delicassen. 
Also, there are two more features in the dataset: Channel and Region. 
All the spendings in products are counted in dollars.
